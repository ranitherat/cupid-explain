            <p>2. You are typically a lowkey person and prefer to keep your relationship off the internet. Your partner brings up that you rarely post a picture of you together on social media and asked if you could post a photo of you together from a recent date. What would you do?</p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="1"> Tell them that they are being insecure and that they care too much about getting validation from other people online.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="0"> Gently explain your boundary on privacy, while validating their feelings, and make a compromise like posting a temporary story.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="0"> Agree to their request, but purposely choose a picture that they look bad in so that they will not ask again.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="0"> Say you will post it later, but intentionally keep "forgetting" to do it until they give up and stop asking.</label>

            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="0"> Agree to talk but bring up unrelated mistakes that they made before.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="0"> Agree and listen to their perspective, and then calmly share your own feelings so that you two can reach a mutual understanding.</label>

            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="0"> Casually ask them who it was and listen to them without jumping into any conclusions.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="1"> Act cold and give them silent treatment without explaining why.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="0"> Snatch the phone out of their hand so you can read everything.</label>

            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="0"> Tell them "whatever you want" but act miserable and sulk the entire anniversary.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="1"> Refuse and insist that your idea is better and that the anniversary is ruined if it doesn’t go as you want.</label>

            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="0"> Say that it's your money and you should be able to spend it however you want.</label>
